Line Cut for Sublime Text
================

This plugin is designed to mimic the Line Cut command in Visual Studio (Ctrl+L) and other editors.

When the command is run, all lines currently selected will be deleted and added to the clipboard. In the case of no selection, the current line is taken.

The default key bindings included assign the command to Alt+x (Ctrl+x for Mac's).
